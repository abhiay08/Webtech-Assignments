<p>Vijaya Dashmi, also known as Dussehra, is among the most important and significant festivals celebrated in India.</p> </font>
<font size="5" face="script" color="brown">
<p>Dussehra is celebrated after Navratri because it is believed that Lord Ram worshipped Goddess Durga before starting his journey to defeat Ravana, on Lord Vishnu's advice
</p></font>
<font size="5" face="optima" color="orange">
<p> It is observed on the tenth day in the Hindu calendar month of Ashvin, the seventh month of the Hindu Luni-Solar Calendar, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October</p></font>
<font size="5" face="futura" color="yellow">
<p>Goddess Durga had also killed demon king Mahishasura who had a head like a buffalo on this day. This celebration is also a reminder of the goddessâ€™ victory over evil.</p></font>
<font size="5" face="didot" color="purple">
<p>The festival of Dussehra, in north India, is celebrated by organising Ramleela theatrical enactment. Lord Ram's devotees also burn massive effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarana, and Meghanada as a part of the celebrations.</p>
